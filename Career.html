    <p><b>One Direction</b></p>
    <p>
        Harry Styles began his music career in 2010 when he auditioned as a solo candidate for the seventh series of
        the British televised singing competition ‘The X Factor.’ Though he could not make it to the finals, he was
        selected along with four other fellow competitors to form a new group act for the remainder of the
        competition.
    <p> 
        <img src="c1.JPG" class="float">
        Styles named the group ‘One Direction.’ The group’s first song, which was also their qualifying song at
        ‘judge’s houses’ round, was an acoustic version of ‘Torn.’ Such was the brilliance of their performance that
        they soon gained popularity in the UK.
        ‘One Direction,’ one of the biggest contenders for the coveted title and people’s favorite, finished third
        in the seventh season of ‘The X Factor.’ Soon after, ‘One Direction’ was signed by Cowell’s ‘Syco Music
        Records’ for a contract worth £2 million.

        In February 2011, the group came up with its book ‘One Direction: Forever Young’ which gave a first-hand
        account of the band’s ‘X-Factor’ story. It topped the ‘Sunday Times Best Seller’ list. Subsequently, they
        went on the ‘X-Factor Live Tour,’ performing throughout the UK.
        After months of recording in various cities including Stockholm, London, and Los Angeles, ‘One Direction’
        came up with its debut album ‘Up All Night’ in 2011. The album debuted at number two on the ‘UK Albums
        Chart’ and ultimately became the UK's fastest-selling debut album of 2011. Their debut single ‘What Makes
        You Beautiful’ debuted at number 1 on the ‘UK Singles Chart.’
        ‘Up All Night’ debuted at number one on the ‘US Billboard 200,’ selling 176,000 copies in its first week. As
        per reports by ‘IFPI,’ ‘Up All Night’ was the third global best-selling album of 2012 with sales of 4.5
        million copies.
        The stupendous success of its first studio album and debut single led ‘One Direction’ to come up with its
        follow-up album ‘Take Me Home’ in 2012. It topped the charts in more than 35 countries. Following the
        footsteps of its predecessor, ‘Take Me Home’ took the number one spot on the ‘US Billboard 200’ chart, thus
        making ‘One Direction’ the first group to top the ‘Billboard 200’ with its first two albums. Also, it became
        the first boy band in US chart history to land two number-one albums in a calendar year.
        The band’s debut album ‘Up All Night’ and its follow up ‘Take Me Home’ became the third and fifth
        best-selling albums of 2012 in the United States, respectively, making the band the first act to place two
        albums in the year-end top five in the ‘Nielsen SoundScan’ era.
        Take Me Home’s lead single ‘Live While We're Young’ showed up at the top ten list in almost every country it
        charted in. It recorded the highest one-week opening sales figure for a song by a non-US artist.

        In 2013, director Morgan Spurlock came up with a documentary of the band titled ‘One Direction: This Is Us’
        which gave a sneak peek of the band’s routine. The film grossed more than $68 million worldwide.
        ‘One Direction’ ended the year 2013 with the release of its third studio album ‘Midnight Memories’ in
        November. Though it opened to mixed reviews by the critics, the album nevertheless fared well, and became
        the best-selling album of 2013, selling more than four million copies.
        A year after its third studio album, ‘One Direction’ came up with its fourth album ‘Four’ in November 2014.
        The album debuted at number one in 18 countries, including the United Kingdom, Australia, and the United
        States. Its lead singles, ‘Steal my Girl’ and ‘Night Changes’ achieved platinum status in the US and gave
        the band its tenth and eleventh UK top-ten hits.

        Replicating the success of the band’s previous three studio albums, ‘Four’ became the band’s fourth
        consecutive album to sell in excess of 1 million copies in the United States. Also, it made ‘One Direction’
        the first band to have its first four albums debut at number one in the United States.
        In March 2015, Zayn Malik, a member of ‘One Direction,’ left the group. Nevertheless, the band continued
        working on its fifth album, which was also the band’s final album before its self-imposed hiatus. The album
        ‘Made in the A.M.’ released in November 2015 to favorable reviews from critics. It debuted at number one on
        the ‘UK Albums Chart’ and at number two on the ‘US Billboard 200.’ Its singles, ‘Drag me Down,’ ‘History,’
        and ‘Perfect’ reached the top 10 spots in a number of national charts.

        As a solo artist, Styles joined Jeffrey Azoff's Full Stop Management and talent agency CAA, signing a
        recording contract with Columbia Records in the first half of 2016. Around this time, he also
        launched his own record label, Erskine Records. Recording for Styles's debut album occurred throughout
        2016 in Los Angeles, London and Port Antonio, Jamaica, where Styles and his collaborators had a two-month
        writing retreat in the autumn. In March 2017, he announced that his first solo single, "Sign of the
        Times", would be released on 7 April. The song peaked at number one on the UK Singles Chart and number
        four on the Billboard Hot 100. A glam rock-influenced soft rock power ballad, it drew
        comparisons to the work of David Bowie. Rolling Stone ranked "Sign of the Times" as the best song of
        2017. Its music video featured Styles flying and walking on water and won the Brit Award for
        British Video of the Year. In April, Styles was a musical guest on Saturday Night Live in the US and
        made his debut televised solo performance in the UK on The Graham Norton Show.

        His self-titled debut album was released in May 2017, whereupon it debuted at number one in several
        countries, including Australia, the UK and the US. The record was influenced by 1970s soft rock and was
        described by Variety as a "classic cocktail of psychedelia, Britpop, and balladry". It received
        generally favourable reviews from critics and was included in several publications' lists of the
        best albums of 2017. Harry Styles yielded two more singles, "Two Ghosts" and "Kiwi". The
        film Harry Styles: Behind the Album, which documented the writing and recording process for the album, was
        released in May exclusively on Apple Music. Styles embarked on his first headlining concert tour, Harry
        Styles: Live on Tour, from September 2017 through to July 2018, performing in North and South Americas,
        Europe, Asia, and Australia.

        Styles made his feature film debut in Christopher Nolan's war film Dunkirk, in July 2017, playing a British
        soldier named Alex in the Dunkirk evacuation during World War II. He appeared alongside an ensemble cast
        which included Fionn Whitehead, Tom Glynn-Carney, Jack Lowden, Kenneth Branagh, Cillian Murphy, Mark
        Rylance, and Tom Hardy. Styles won the part over "thousands of young men"; Nolan later admitted he
        was unaware of the extent of Styles' fame and that he was cast "because he fit the part wonderfully and
        truly earned a seat at the table".The Daily Telegraph film critic Robbie Collin praised Styles for
        his "bright, convicted, and unexpectedly not-at-all-jarring performance".

        In November 2017, BBC One broadcast Harry Styles at the BBC, a one-hour television special presented by Nick
        Grimshaw. At 2017 ARIA Music Awards, Styles received the Best International Artist award. He
        guest-hosted The Late Late Show with James Corden in December. Together with Jack Antonoff and Ilsey
        Juber, Styles co-wrote "Alfie's Song (Not So Typical Love Song)", performed by the band Bleachers, for the
        soundtrack of the film Love, Simon (2018). He also served as an executive producer on the CBS sitcom
        Happy Together, which premiered in October 2018 and was inspired by his time living with television producer
        Ben Winston. In 2018, Styles began modelling for the Italian fashion house Gucci, appearing in several
        campaigns for the brand.

        "Lights Up", the lead single from Styles's second album, Fine Line, was released in October 2019, debuting
        at number three in the UK. The song featured a "soft-touch re-entry into the pop slipstream",
        according to music writer Jon Caramanica. Styles served as both host and musical guest on Saturday Night
        Live in November. The second single preceding Fine Line, "Adore You", was released in December, peaking
        at number seven in the UK and at number six in the US. That month, Styles again guest-hosted The
        Late Late Show with James Corden.

        Fine Line was released on 13 December. The album was recorded at the Shangri-La studio in Malibu, California
        with the same production team behind Styles's debut album and featured a similar sound to Harry Styles while
        also incorporating elements of funk and soul. It received generally positive reviews from
        critics. The album peaked at number two in the UK and topped the US charts, breaking the record as
        the biggest sales debut from an English male artist in the US since Nielsen SoundScan began electronically
        tracking sales data in 1991. Singer-songwriter Stevie Nicks, who referred to Styles as "the son [she]
        never had", likened Fine Line to Fleetwood Mac's album Rumours and commented that it inspired her to
        write new music. Rolling Stone ranked it at number 491 in their 2020 list of the "500 Greatest Albums of
        All Time". Five other singles, "Falling", "Watermelon Sugar", "Golden", "Treat People with Kindness" and
        the title track, were released from the album. "Watermelon Sugar" became Styles's fourth UK top-ten
        single, peaking at number four, as well as his first number-one single in the US. A tour to
        support Fine Line, entitled Love On Tour, which was originally set to take place throughout 2020, was
        postponed until 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

        At the 2020 Brit Awards, Styles was nominated for British Male Solo Artist and British Album of the
        Year. In March 2020, he performed an NPR Tiny Desk concert, and in July, he narrated a bedtime
        story titled Dream with Me for the relaxation app Calm. Later that year, Styles won the Favorite
        Pop/Rock Album award for Fine Line at the 48th American Music Awards, the Best International Artist
        award at the 34th ARIA Music Awards, and the Chart Achievement Award at the 27th Billboard Music
        Awards. He was also named Variety's Hitmaker of the Year. At the 63rd Annual Grammy Awards in
        March 2021, he received three nominations for Best Pop Vocal Album (Fine Line), Best Pop Solo Performance
        ("Watermelon Sugar") and Best Music Video ("Adore You"), winning for Best Pop Solo Performance.
        "Watermelon Sugar" also earned Styles his second Brit Award for British Single of the Year during the 2021
        ceremony. At the 2021 Ivor Novello Awards, "Adore You" won the award for Most Performed Work.
        Styles made a cameo appearance as Eros / Starfox, brother of Thanos, in the mid-credits scene of the Marvel
        Cinematic Universe superhero film Eternals, which was released in November 2021. He launched his
        cosmetics brand, Pleasing, that month.</p>

        countries. Styles headlined the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival later that month,
        ahead of the release of Harry's House on 20 May. He is also set to star as Jack in the upcoming
        psychological thriller film Don't Worry Darling, directed by Olivia Wilde, and will portray the titular
        character in My Policeman, a film adaptation of the 2012 novel of the same name.
